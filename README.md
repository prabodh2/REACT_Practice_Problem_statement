This weather dashboard, developed using React JS, features a search bar that allows users to retrieve and view the current weather conditions of any specified city. Upon search, the dashboard displays the city's current temperature, humidity level, wind speed, and an icon representing the prevailing weather conditions. Data is fetched in real-time from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The implementation utilizes React's useEffect and useState hooks. These hooks are integral for state management and lifecycle methods within the component. The useState hook is employed to create and manage state variables, which, when updated, trigger the component to rerender. The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data from the API when the component mounts or updates.

Overall, the use of these hooks facilitates a seamless user experience by ensuring the UI dynamically responds to user interactions and updates efficiently based on the latest data.
